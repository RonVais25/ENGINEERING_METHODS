## 📖 About

**GoNature** is a distributed park visit management system developed for the *Parks and Recreation Department* as part of course **61756 – Engineering Methods for Software Development** at our college.

The system helps the department manage visitor activity across multiple nature parks - handling reservations, group visits, visitor quotas, entry control, and monthly reports - all through a centralized yet distributed client-server architecture.
